# cloud-project
Learning the basics of cloud engineering. Mainly focusing on Docker, GitHub Cl, Ansible, Terraform and using Python and maybe Java to gather information. I am currently using GitHub as a way to keep track of my learning of cloud engineering 

The name is currently just a placeholder 

**Main Project Idea: **
Create GitHub to create a lynnode server by running a pipeline. 

When the server spins up, it will pull down the ansible playbook. Then deploy docker container. Use Terraform to deploy your Lynnode servers and move the workload to AWS.
